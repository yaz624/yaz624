## 🧠 Who am I?

- 🧑‍💻 Developer by day, debugger by night  
- 📚 Allegedly graduated with a tech degree. Still Googling `how to exit Vim`
- 💡 Believes `printf` is a lifestyle, not a function
- 🐛 Can find bugs in your code... even if they're intentional

## 🛠️ What I'm working with:

```python
class YankaiZhao:
    def __init__(self):
        self.languages = ['Python', 'JavaScript', 'C++', 'Maybe Klingon']
        self.hobbies = ['Coding', 'Meme Debugging', 'Reading commit messages']
        self.current_mood = "Shipping to production and praying 🙏"
🌍 Fun Facts:
	•	I write code that sometimes works on the first try. I know, shocking.
	•	Once wrote a script to automate writing other scripts. It went… okay.
	•	Known to use git commit -m "final_final_REALLY_FINAL" unironically.
